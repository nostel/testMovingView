/** `AZGradient` defines a transition between colors.  The transition
 is defined over a range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive.  A gradient typically
 contains a color at location 0.0, and one at location 1.0 with additional
 colors assigned to locations between 0.0 and 1.0.
 
 `AZGradient` is a drawing primitive that can draw itself as a linear
 or radial gradient.  The color value at location 0.0 is considered the
 starting color, the color value at location 1.0 is considered the ending
 color.
