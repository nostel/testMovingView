@class AZGradient;

/** `AZTableViewCell` is a subclass of `UITableViewCell`, and is
 compatible with any `UITableView`.

 `AZTableViewCell` adds a set of customizations such as corner radius,
 shadow, background gradient, and selection gradient.

 ### Using it

 In your `dataSource`'s `-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:`, change all
 references to `UITableViewCell` to `AZTableViewCell`.

 #### Performance considerations

 One tip that will get you very far with iOS graphics programming:
 alpha blending is slow. If you intend for a cell to have a shadow,
 *set the background color*. The resulting cell will be opaque, and
 composite onto screen extremely quickly.

 Normally, this also implies that the table view and cells must use
 the same solid background color - hey, it's flat UI design! However,
 the `UIColor` pattern system and pattern phase might still allow
 textured backgrounds.

 ### Customizing appearance

 Cells are compatible with both grouped and plain tables, though they
 generally look better in grouped tables.

 #### Grouped tables

 You can change the cell's appearance as follows:

 - cell's drop shadow color (border will be disabled when set).
 - cell's opaque background color (for when a shadow is used).
 - cell's fill color or gradient.
 - cell's border color (ignored when the shadow color is set).
 - cell's corner radius.
 - cell's separator color.
 - cell's selection gradient.

 #### Plain tables

 You can change the cell's appearance as follows:

 - cell's fill color or gradient.
 - cell's separator.
 - cell's selection gradient.
